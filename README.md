## 📖 Overview

**Holmes** is a lightweight and modular backdoor detection tool built for Windows system auditing. It identifies suspicious behaviors across processes, persistence mechanisms, network connections, and file execution — all from a clean terminal interface.

Holmes is **self-configuring**: on first run, it installs its own dependencies, initializes the SQLite database, and prepares its internal structure. No manual setup required.

```
⚡ Lightweight    🧩 Modular    🔍 Transparent    🖥️ Low resource usage
```

## 🌐 Internet Dependency

Holmes is **offline-first** in its analysis, but requires internet access for:

| Feature | Requirement |
|---|---|
| 📦 Dependency installation | First run only |
| 🔬 VirusTotal hash analysis | Active internet + API key |

---

## ✨ Features

<details>
<summary><strong>🔍 Process Analysis</strong></summary>

<br/>

- List and inspect all active processes
- Detect anomalous executable paths
- Collect: PID, PPID, process name, executable path, user, file hash, digital signature
- Compare against security blacklists
- Auto-insert results into SQLite

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🧷 Persistence Detection</strong></summary>

<br/>

Detects mechanisms used to keep malware active across reboots:

- **Registry keys:** `HKCU\...\Run` and `HKLM\...\Run`
- **Windows Services**
- **Scheduled Tasks**
- **Startup folders**

Each entry includes: hash, digital signature, user, and binary path.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🌐 Network Module</strong></summary>

<br/>

- Monitor active connections
- Map connections to their owning processes
- Compare against suspicious IP/domain lists
- Flag potentially malicious traffic
- Auto-insert into database

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔎 Manual Analysis Mode</strong></summary>

<br/>

Individually investigate any suspicious element:

- Processes, files, services, scheduled tasks, network connections
- Hash calculation + digital signature verification
- VirusTotal lookup
- Blacklist comparison
- Environment variable expansion and path normalization

</details>

## ⚡ Defensive Actions

Holmes isn't just passive — when a suspicious item is found, you can act directly from the interface:

| Target | Available Actions |
|---|---|
| 🔍 **Process** | Terminate suspicious process |
| 🧷 **Registry** | Remove persistence entry |
| ⚙️ **Service** | Disable service · Kill associated process |
| 📅 **Scheduled Task** | Disable task |
| 🌐 **Network** | Terminate process tied to connection |

## 🗄️ Database (Auto-Initialized)

Holmes manages its own SQLite database with zero manual configuration:

- ✅ Created automatically on first run
- ✅ Tables initialized by Holmes itself
- ✅ Auto-populated by each module (processes, persistence, network)
- ✅ Ready for audit history and future expansion

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** installed and added to `PATH`
- **Administrator privileges** (required for system-level access)

---

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/holmes.git
cd holmes
```

---

### 2. Create the `.env` file

In the project root, create a `.env` file:

```env
HOLMES_API_KEY=YOUR_VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY
```

> 🔑 Get your free API key at [virustotal.com](https://www.virustotal.com/)

---

### 3. Run as Administrator

> ⚠️ Administrator rights are required to read system processes, services, registry, and scheduled tasks.

Right-click **Command Prompt** → *Run as administrator*, then:

```bash
cd C:\Path\To\Holmes
python main.py
```

Holmes handles everything else automatically on first launch.
